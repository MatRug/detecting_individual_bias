# On Detecting Biased Predictions with Post-hoc Explanation Methods

The current repository contains the codes used for the study, on the detecting of biased prediction with post-hoc explanation methods.

### Preliminaries of the experiment

The code *NN_builder.py* is the code used to train the models on the datasets presented in section 3.1, and the results on the accuracy of the models are shown in section B.1.

The codes *lime_conv.py* and *shap_conv.py* are used to investigate how the number of samples influences LIME and SHAP output.

### Weights investigation

*lime_analyses.py*, *shap_analyses.py*, and *anchor_analyses.py* are the code used to get the results from the post-hoc explanation tools used for the investigation.
